        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different components in electronics. Some of them you
            are probably familiar with, such as batteries, switches, and light 
            bulbs. Some are less obvious such as resistors, capacitors, diodes,
            and many other devices. On top of the standard devices that you are
            used to using, there are also measurement tools that can be used to
            find values such as electric potential and current.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only are there many components, there are many ways to wire those
            components in order to achieve different effects. How the components
            wired affects their function and we will be exploring this with
            resistors. In these activities you will be learning about circuit
            and how the pathway that electricity is provided affects their function.

                <td colspan="4">We will use two types of resistors. Most resistors
                    are labeled with three colored bands to help you identify what
                    the resistance is and a fourth that denotes tolerance.
                    The first two bands identify the first
                    two digits of the resistance. The third band is the 
                    multiplier. There is sometimes a fourth band that represents
                    the tolerance. Below is a key for reading resistors.
