        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different components in electronics. Some of them you
            are probably familiar with, such as batteries, switches, and light 
            bulbs. Some are less obvious such as resistors, capacitors, diodes,
            and many other devices. On top of the standard devices that you are
            used to using, there are also measurement tools that can be used to
            find values such as electric potential and current.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only are there many components, there are many ways to wire those
            components in order to achieve different effects. How the components
            wired affects their function and we will be exploring this with
            resistors. In these activities you will be learning about circuit
            and how the pathway that electricity is provided affects their function.

                    are labeled with three colored bands to help you identify what
                    the resistance is and a fourth that denotes tolerance.
                    The first two bands identify the first
                    two digits of the resistance. The third band is the 
                    multiplier. There is sometimes a fourth band that represents
                    the tolerance. Below is a key for reading resistors.

                    Short Circuits occur because electricity is provided a
                    pathway to flow in a way that bypasses a component.
                    Electricity will take the path of least resistance whenever
                    possible, so if there is a wire with very little resistance
                    running in parallel to your component, most of the 
                    current will run that way.
                    <br>
                    There will be two major effects due to this. The first is
                    that the comonent will not behave as expected. This could
                    mean that an LED doesn't light up, or a motor doesn't turn.
                    The other effect can be much more serious. By providing
                    a pathway for electricity to flow with very little
                    resistance, current can increase greatly. This can lead
                    to increased heat, even fire if the component cannot 
                    handle the increased thermal energy.
