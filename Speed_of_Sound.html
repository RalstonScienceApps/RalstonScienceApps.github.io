        <p>Have you ever noticed that you always see a firework go off before you
            actually hear the sound? Why is that? We will be investigating this phenonmenon
            by measuring the speed of sound. Ideally, in order to get a measurement
            we would need to make a sound with a visual cue and then time how
            long it takes for the sound to reach our ears. There are many sources of
            error in this method however, and it also requires far more space than we have.
            Instead we will be looking at sound waves with technology!
