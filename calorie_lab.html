                    <p>Energy is crucial to the survival of every living thing. 
                        As humans, our bodies need to remain within a relatively 
                        narrow temperature range. We “burn food” (internally) to 
                        stay warm. Additionally, because all systems tend to move 
                        toward disorder without an input of energy, we would die 
                        without food. We need bodily fuel so that we can function, 
                        and we burn it when we walk, talk, sleep, exercise, and 
                        study. You may have heard of “burning calories” in reference 
                        to exercise. Please note that calories are never burned. 
                        A calorie is simply a measure of energy, and that energy 
                        is actually released during a combustion reaction. During 
                        exercise, the body burns food to release energy, and that 
                        energy can be measured in different units, such as calories. 
                        The evening before a marathon, runners are advised to eat a 
                        huge plate of pasta. Why? Because pasta,is a carbohydrate, is 
                        a terrific source of energy, or fuel for the body. Different 
                        foods contain varying amounts of energy, or calories. In 
                        other words, calories are a way to measure the energy you get 
                        from the food you eat. Food contains Potential Energy stored 
                        in its chemical bonds. When we consume and digest the food we 
                        break the bonds and convert it into Kinetic Energy that we 
                        can use for motion.</p>

                    <p>In this activity, you will demonstrate how calories are 
                    measured. First, you need to build an inexpensive calorimeter. 
                    A calorimeter is a device that measures the transfer of heat 
                    energy during a chemical or physical change. One type of 
                    calorimeter contains a combustion chamber surrounded by water. 
                    When matter is placed in the chamber and physically or 
                    chemically changed (usually by burning), the temperature change 
                    of the surrounding water is measured and used to determine the 
                    energy (calorie) content of the sample. This lab indirectly 
                    measures food Calories (kilocalories) using a homemade calorimeter.</p>
